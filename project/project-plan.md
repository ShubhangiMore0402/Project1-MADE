### Project Overview

**Title**: **Global Trends in Fossil CO2 Emissions and Air Travel Emission Intensities**

**Main Question**:

1. How have global fossil CO2 emissions evolved from 1991 to 2016?
2. What are the trends in air travel emission intensities between 2019 to 2022 period?
3. How do these emissions correlate with economic indicators such as GDP?
4. What is the relationship between tourism activities and emission intensities?

**Objective**: 
The project aims to analyze and understand the trends in fossil CO2 emissions and air travel emission intensities globally from 1991 to 2016. By examining the relationship between these emissions and economic activities, specifically GDP and tourism, we aim to provide insights into how different factors influence environmental impacts over time.

**Datasets**:
1. **Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), version v4.3.2_FT_2016**:
   - Publisher: Joint Research Centre
   - Content: Fossil CO2 and GHG time-series data from 1970 to 2016.
   - URL: [EDGAR Dataset](https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/jrc-opendata/EDGAR/datasets/v432_FT2016/EDGARv432_FT2016_CO2_per_GDP_emissions_1970-2016.csv)

2. **UDP - Air Travel Emission Intensity**:
   - Publisher: Joint Research Centre
   - Content: Air travel emission intensity data.
   - URL: [UDP Dataset](https://urban.jrc.ec.europa.eu/api/udp/v2/en/data/?databrick_id=739&nutslevel=0&ts=TOURISM&nutsversion=-1&mpx=1&nutslevel=9&format=csv)

**Methodology**:
1. **Data Collection and Exploration**:
   - Download and load the datasets.
   - Conduct initial exploratory data analysis to understand data structure, identify missing values, and check for errors.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and correct data errors.
   - Standardize data formats for consistency.

3. **Data Analysis and Feature Extraction**:
   - Perform detailed analysis to identify trends and patterns.
   - Calculate relevant metrics, such as emissions per GDP and per capita.
   - Create visualizations to illustrate key findings.

4. **Modeling and Interpretation**:
   - Apply statistical or machine learning models to analyze relationships.
   - Interpret the results in the context of economic and tourism activities.

5. **Reporting and Presentation**:
   - Compile findings into a comprehensive report.
   - Develop visual presentations to convey insights effectively.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Detailed trends and patterns of fossil CO2 emissions and air travel emission intensities from 1991 to 2016.
- Insights into the impact of economic growth and tourism on emissions.
- Recommendations for policymakers on mitigating emissions while supporting economic activities.

**Significance**:
Understanding the historical trends and correlations between emissions and economic activities can help inform future policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining economic development. This project will provide valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders interested in sustainable development and environmental protection.
